### Question issues
*   A whole 'nother is contested as "nother" is apparently a word. i'd argue, however, that the original meaning of "a whole nother" (~1900s) does use "nother" in its original context, but the contemporary use of this word in the phrase does not. Most people don't know that "nother" is a word nor what it means (albeit it's easy to guess). I'm sure that if most people who use the phrase "a whole nother" were to break down its meaning, they would come to the same conclusion that others have ie that the word "another" is being split after the "a" and the word "whole" is being thrown in for emphasis. It would follow a not uncommon tendency of splitting multi-syllable words at the first syllable and adding an adjective in-between. For example, "un-fucking-believable"
