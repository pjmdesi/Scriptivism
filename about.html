	<p><b>What is this?</b></p>
	<p><i>Scriptivism</i> is a fake word taken from the real words <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description">Descriptivism</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription">Prescriptivism</a></i>. <i>Mehscriptivism</i> is another made-up word which just means you fall in the middle of those two ends of the spectrum.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Types of Scriptivists</b></p>
	<div class="cardGrid">
		<div id="preCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Prescriptivists</b> strictly adhere to the rules of a language, using those rules to be specific and unambiguous. Often, this demands a wide, nich√© vocabulary as they usually avoid "slang".</p>
		</div>
		<div id="mehCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Mehscriptivists</b> don't care too much about following the rules. They do what makes sense to them, and it works most of the time. They use language in ways that falls equally on both sides of the spectrum.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="deCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Descriptivists</b> use language more loosely, relying on context and social interaction for the dynamic meaning of words and phrases, sometimes directly violating "the rules." They invent new words and phrases frequently.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p><b>Which is best?</b></p>
	<p>In order for a language to remain useful, it must evolve when: new technology is invented, strange concepts are explored, and unique art is created. A healthy language requires people who fall on all parts of the scriptivism spectrum.</p>
	<p>One may think that <span class="de">Descriptivists</span> are just <i>wrong</i>. For instance, when someone uses the word "ginormous", a <span class="pre">Prescriptivist</span> might call that "slang" and point out that it's a combination of <i>gigantic</i> and <i>enormous</i>. But everone knows what a person means when they say "ginormous". "Anyway<b>s</b>" isn't technically correct, but people use it instead of "anyway", anyway. That makes "Anyway<b>s</b>" a <i>Descriptivist</i> word and "Anyway" a <i>Prescriptivist</i> word. The choice for each word/phrase is binary: either it's <i>Prescriptivist</i> or <i>Descriptivist</i>. But a person using language naturally will always use a mix of words and phrases, and therefore will fall on a spectrum.</p>
