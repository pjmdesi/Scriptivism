	<p><b>Types of Scriptivists</b></p>
	<div class="cardGrid">
		<div id="preCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Prescriptivists</b> strictly adhere to the rules of a language, using those rules to be specific and unambiguous. Often, this demands a wide, nich√© vocabulary and complex grammar.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="mehCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Mehscriptivists</b> don't care too much about following the rules. They do what makes sense to them, and it works most of the time. They use language in ways that fall on both sides of the spectrum.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="deCard" class="card">
			<p><b>Descriptivists</b> use language more loosely, relying on context and social interaction for the meaning of words and phrases, sometimes directly violating "the rules."</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p><b>Which is best?</b></p>
	<p>In order for a language to remain useful, it must evolve when: new technology is invented, strange concepts are explored, and unique art is created. A healthy language is used by people who fall on all parts of the scriptivism spectrum. Language needs experimentors and curators to get better.</p>
	<p>One may think that <span class="de">Descriptivists</span> are just <i>wrong</i>. For instance, when someone uses the word "ginormous", a <span class="pre">Prescriptivist</span> might call that "slang" and point out that it's a combination of <i>gigantic</i> and <i>enormous</i>. But everone knows what a person means when they say "ginormous".
