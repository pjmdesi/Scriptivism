	<p>Meh: You don't care too much about following the rules. You do what makes sense to you, and it works most of the time.</p>
	<p>De: You use language loosely, relying on context and social understanding to add meaning to simpler, narrower word choices.</p>

	<br />
	<p>Common differences in pres vs des and an explaination of the spectrum. Explain how some things are difficult to ask Qs about like dangling participles.</p>
